# Heart-disease-prediction

Heart disease is a significant cause of mortality, and the most crucial task is the prediction of heart disease
based on huge amounts of medical data. Machine learning can significantly benefit this medical field by
providing an accurate diagnosis. In this report, we use state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for heart
disease prediction. Data preprocess like one-hot encoding, standardization, oversampling and downsampling,
etc. were done first. The AutoML method was then performed to get an overview of the performance of
the different machine learning algorithms with different levels of complexity. The tree-based models were
found to be outperformed other models, we then used the cross-validated grid search on the models to find
the best hyperparameters, and it comes the best GBDT model achieved 97.44% accuracy. Besides, model
performance, feature exploration, and model interpretation have been presented and discussed in detail.
